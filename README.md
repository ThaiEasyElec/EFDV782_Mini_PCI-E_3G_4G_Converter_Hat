rego600-control
===============

These are misc files which I use to control an IVT ground heat pump with Rego637 control module at my summer cottage. Bad code, so be warned ;)

Quick list of the files:
 - athome.pl - Turns settings good for being at home
 - holiday.pl - Turns settings and heat good for being away from home
 - skipweek.pl - Turns settings good for a skipweek (ie. at home for the weekend, then be away for working days and come back at next weekend)
 - key1.pl - Press left key on keypad
 - key2.pl - Press middle key on keypad
 - key3.pl - Press right key on keypad
 - left.pl - Turn wheel one step left / counter-clockwise
 - right.pl - Turn wheel one step right / clockwise
 - ivt.pl - Gather statistics and send them to zabbix
 - display.pl - Prints what the display says
