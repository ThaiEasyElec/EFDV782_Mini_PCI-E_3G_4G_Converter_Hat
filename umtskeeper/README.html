    Note: This document is a partial copy of the UMTSkeeper website for your convenience. The most current version can be found at this location: <a href="http://mintakaconciencia.net/squares/umtskeeper/">http://mintakaconciencia.net/squares/umtskeeper/</a>.
  </p>
  
	<a name="installation"></a>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    To run the program, Python2 needs to be installed (it's made with 2.7). Python is installed with many distributions by default. If not, it should be in your package repositories, or you can download it from here: <a href="http://python.org/download/">http://python.org/download/</a>. Be aware that Python3 is not necessarily backward compatible with Python2 code. It's likely that UMTSkeeper will not run with Python3 - I did not test it yet.
  </p>
	<p>
		UMTSkeeper uses the Sakis3G script by Sakis Dimopoulos to set up the modem and connect to the net. You can download Sakis3G from the Sakis3G website <a href="http://www.sakis3g.org/">http://www.sakis3g.org/</a> (the author of UMTSkeeper is not afiliated with Sakis Dimopoulos). I take the "binary free" version, yet the "full" (including usb_modeswitch) will do as well. Read the manual!<br>
    If Sakis' website is down then you can get it from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sakis3g.org/">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sakis3g.org/</a>. There is a (binary free) version available on Sourceforge.net, too:  <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/vim-n4n0/sakis3g.tar.gz">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/vim-n4n0/sakis3g.tar.gz</a> (thanks BigCowPi for the link).
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll do the commands that have to be given as the <span class="out">root</span> user (or superuser, the general linux system administrator), using the <span class="command">sudo</span> program, which asks you for your own password every time and which is the standard way on freshly installed Ubuntu systems. On other systems you may type <span class="command">su</span> to become <span class="out">root</span>. (sidenote: to activate the root account on Ubuntu, define a password for it: <span class="command">sudo passwd</span>)<br>
    Also, for packet installation, I will use the <span class="command">apt-get</span> command, which is standard on Debian based distributions (also various flavors of *ubuntu and Raspbian). On other distributions I assume that you are familiar with whatever packet installer it uses (<span class="command">yum</span> etc.).
  </p>
  
  <h3>Upgrading from version 1.xx</h3>
  <p>
    Version 2 is designed to be a drop-in replacement for version 1.xx. Anyway, make a backup of your files first, then extract the new program files into the version 1.xx program directory. Version 2.xx will first convert your umtskeeper.stat file to a new format and add a few items. The px*.png files are not needed anymore.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Prepare</h3>
  <p>
		UMTSkeeper and Sakis3G should reside in the same directory. In this example it's <span class="path">/home/mintaka/umtskeeper/</span> - a subdirectory of my <span class="path">home</span> directory, where <span class="out">mintaka</span> is my user name. Substitute <span class="out">mintaka</span> with your own user name. (Alternatively, you can put it in any location you find suitable). Typing <span class="command">pwd</span> will show you the exact location you are working in which you will need later when you automate things (thanks BigCowPi for simplyfying this procedure).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't have internet on your target system yet, <a href="#download">download</a> and transport the files there. The archive contains a "readme" file with these instructions as well.
  </p>
    
	In a terminal, download and extract both scripts and make them executable (input line-by-line):
	<p class="code command">
    cd ~<br>
    pwd<br>
		mkdir umtskeeper<br>
		cd umtskeeper/<br>
		wget "http://www.sakis3g.org/versions/latest/binary-free/sakis3g.gz"<br>
		gunzip sakis3g.gz<br>
		chmod +x sakis3g<br>
		wget "http://mintakaconciencia.net/squares/umtskeeper/src/umtskeeper.tar.gz"<br>
		tar -xzvf umtskeeper.tar.gz<br>
		chmod +x umtskeeper<br>
	</p>
  
  <p>
    Also make sure that your system properly detects the modem. The usual type of modem available will first register as a storage device to the system, containing a Windows executable which installs the modem manager software (on Windows, that is). On Linux, these devices may need to be switched to modem mode with the program <span class="out">usb_modeswitch</span>, which should be available in your packet repositories (try <span class="command">sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch</span> before you go compile it yourself). There's also a "binary" version available on the Sakis3G website which includes usb_modeswitch. Many modems are pre-configured in usb_modeswitch to work out-of-the-box, so there's no more to be done there. If your modem is not switched automatically then you can find more on configuring usb_modeswitch on the <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/">usb_modeswitch site</a> and its <a href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/">forum</a>.
  </p>
	<p>
		The clever way is to first connect manually with Sakis3G in interactive mode. Sakis3G will give you hints for the options to use. Do it as <span class="out">root</span>:
		<p class="code command">
			sudo ./sakis3g --interactive
		</p>
		<p>
		Hint: if you are asked for APN user or APN password but you have none, enter "0".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ubuntu users</b>: do not set up an automatic connect with the GNOME network manager because it interferes with Sakis3G. You will likely use a headless machine, therefore the NM will not be useful anyway, so consider to uninstall it. This might apply to other distributions as well, I didn't test. You can still set up your network connections in <span class="path">/etc/network/interfaces</span>. To remove, type <span class="command">sudo apt-get remove network-manager</span>.
    </p>
	</p>
  
  <h3>First Run</h3>
	<p>
		If your connection works in interactive mode, unplug and re-plug your modem and try with UMTSkeeper with all the switches and options, also as <span class="out">root</span>.<br>
    For example (this is a single line, mind the quotes!):
		<p class="code">
			<span class="command">sudo ./umtskeeper --sakisoperators "USBINTERFACE='0' OTHER='USBMODEM' USBMODEM='12d1:140c' SIM_PIN='1234' APN='CUSTOM_APN' CUSTOM_APN='provider.com' APN_USER='0' APN_PASS='0'" --sakisswitches "--sudo --console" --devicename 'Huawei' --log --silent --nat 'no'</span><br>
			<br>
			umtskeeper: process not found
		</p>
    <p>
      UMTSkeeper will stay running after this. To end it, press the key combination <span class="command">CTRL+C</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When run for the first time some log files will be created, among them <span class="path">/var/log/umtskeeper.log</span> (the main log file), <span class="path">umtskeeper.stat.html</span> (HTML statistics file to view in your web browser), and <span class="path">umtskeeper.stat</span> (the file which keeps the numbers for the next run). To view <span class="path">umtskeeper.log</span>, best open a second terminal and use <span class="command">cat</span> or <span class="command">tail</span> to view its content. It should contain something like this:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td><td class="code command">cat /var/log/umtskeeper.log<br>&nbsp;</td><td style="width:25em"></td>

For such (rare) cases, a backup of that file is kept.</td>
      </tr><tr>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      If you unplug your modem now and re-plug it again then the connection should be established automatically. Give usb_modeswitch and Sakis3G a little patience.
    </p>
	</p>
	<p>    
    <h3>Automatic Start</h3>
    <p>
      Last, you want to start UMTSkeeper automatically after boot. Put a line into <span class="path">/etc/rc.local</span> like this (it's a single line which will make it run in the background and redirect screen output to an <span class="path">error.log</span> file):  <span class="path">/etc/rc.local</span> has to be edited by the <span class="out">root</span> user. Replace the path <span class="path">/home/mintaka/</span> in this example by the path you found out previously.
    </p>
    <p class="code command">
      /home/mintaka/umtskeeper/umtskeeper --sakisoperators "USBINTERFACE='0' OTHER='USBMODEM' USBMODEM='12d1:140c' SIM_PIN='1234' APN='CUSTOM_APN' CUSTOM_APN='provider.com' APN_USER='0' APN_PASS='0'" --sakisswitches "--sudo --console" --devicename 'Huawei' --log --silent --monthstart 8 --nat 'no' --httpserver &>> /home/mintaka/umtskeeper/error.log &
    </p>
  </p>
	<p>
		A line for only logging transfer statistics on <span class="out">wlan0</span> would for example look like this:
		<p class="code command">
			/home/mintaka/umtskeeper/umtskeeper --logonly --log --silent --monthstart 14 --iface 'wlan0' --httpserver &>> /home/mintaka/umtskeeper/error.log &
		</p>
	</p>
	
  <p>
    <h3>Dynamic DNS updater</h3>
    There are two ways of using DDNS with UMTSkeeper: either let it call an external command line tool (if your DNS provider has a proprietary protocol), or use the internal update methods. Two methods are currently implemented: one is for the "freedns" style method which uses only an URL with an update code, and the other is the so-called "Members NIC Update API", invented by dyn.com and widely adopted by other services. The updater has been tested with freedns.afraid.org, dyn.com (dyndns.com) and no-ip.com.<br>
    The DNS updater must be configured by configuration file, as the configuration potentially contains sensitive data. See the sample config file for more information.<br>
    Notice, that if you use the DNS updater together with the webserver then your transfer statistics will be more easily accessible from the internet. If you don't want this, you can obfuscate the server by using a port other than standard HTTP port 80 (default is 8000), or you can secure it by using the IP whitelist feature.
  </p>


	<a name="uninstall"></a>
  <h2>Uninstallation</h2>
	<p>
    Currently, UMTSkeeper does not have an uninstaller (just as there is no installer). To remove it without a trace, delete <span class="path">/var/log/umtskeeper.log</span> and the whole program directory, and any special HTML dirs and temp dirs you may have made. That should be all.
  </p>
	

	<a name="params"></a>
	<h2>Parameters and Customization</h2>
	<p>
      <h3>Configuration file:</h3>
			All configuration can be done with command line parameters or in a configuration file. UMTSkeeper will look for <span class="path">&lt;progPath&gt;/umtskeeper.conf</span> (1). The configuration goes this way: (1) overrides the program defaults, and values in a config file given by the <span class="command">--conf &lt;conffile&gt;</span> command line directive overrides (1). Further, any parameters given on the command line will override the values from the config files. An example config file (<span class="path">umtskeeper.conf.sample</span>) is included in the package, along with a lot of explanation.

		  <h3>Commands:</h3>
      <span class="command">connect</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Retry connecting for example if connecting was suspended by --sakismaxfails.</div>
      <span class="command">resetmonth</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Manually reset the monthly transfer counter.</div>
      <span class="command">resettransferstats</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Reset the transfer amount counters. This will not reset the rate counters. Data will be deleted without asking again.</div>
      <span class="command">resetratestats</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Reset the rate counters. This will not reset the transfer amount counters. Data will be deleted without asking again.</div>
      <span class="command">stop, quit, end</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Any of these will terminate a running UMTSkeeper.</div>


		  <h3>Options:</h3>
      <span class="command">--log</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Log to file (default: don't log). See also: logfile.</div>
      <span class="command">--logonly</span><br>
      <div class="indent">Do not connect to internet. Use this for only logging statistics on a connection. Recommended only for (W)LAN devices. (default: do connect)</div>
      <span class="command">--noroot</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Force running without requiring root privileges. The default behaviour is that if writing to system dirs returns "permission denied", it switches to no-root mode. This means, that all temp files and logs will be stored in the program directory. This switch is the equivalent of setting the config variables <span class="command">conf['logFile']=progPath+'umtskeeper.log'</span>, <span class="command">conf['tempPath']=progPath</span>, and <span class="command">conf['statFilePath']=progPath</span>.</div>
      <span class="command">--nostats</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Don't write statistics files. (default: write them)</div>
      <span class="command">--htmlstats</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Generate a HTML page without the internal webserver running. The HTML file is by default written to the temp dirctory: <span class="path">/run/umtskeeper/umtskeeper.stat.html</span> or <span class="path">/var/run/umtskeeper/umtskeeper.stat.html</span>. If <span class="command">--htmlPath</span> is given then the HTML file is copied there. (default: none)</div>
      <span class="command">--silent</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Suppress screen output. (default: verbose)</div>
      <span class="command">--httpserver</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Run the internal webserver (default: off). See also <span class="command">--httpport</span>.</div>
			
      <h3>Parameters:</h3>
      <span class="command">--conf &lt;/path/to/configfile&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Specify a configuration file to use. For the order of configuration, look above. (default: none)</div>
      <span class="command">--iface &lt;iface&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Network interface to monitor. (default: ppp0)</div>
			<span class="command">--nat &lt;iface&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Enable internet connection forwarding (NAT). <span class="out">&lt;iface&gt;</span> is the name of the network adapter that connects to the internet. Often, this is <span class="out">ppp0</span> (look it up with <span class="command">ifconfig</span> when the connection is up). Set to 'no' if no forwarding is required (default: no)</div>
      <span class="command">--testcycle &lt;s&gt;</span> (formerly <span class="command">--interval</span>)<br>
			<div class="indent">Test connection in intervals of s statistics cycles (1 cycle is about 4 seconds). (default: 8).</div>
      <span class="command">--sakismaxfails &lt;n&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Maximum of failed connection retries by Sakis3G in sequence until the program gives up (actually it tries twice in a cycle). This parameter should help to save on power, especially with battery driven machines. Sakis3G is CPU intensive. So, if for any reason (modem unplugged or other failure) the connection doesn't work then we'd better give up constantly trying. See also <span class="command">--sakisfaillockduration</span>. (default: 4)</div>
      <span class="command">--sakisfaillockduration &lt;s&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Duration (in seconds) after which we retry to connect after the maximum of failed connection retries was reached. See also <span class="command">--sakismaxfails</span>. (default: 300)</div>
      <span class="command">--logfile "&lt;file&gt;"</span><br>
			<div class="indent">To specify an alternative log file (default: <span class="path">/var/log/umtskeeper.log</span>). This implies the option 'log'.</div>
      <span class="command">--devicename "&lt;string&gt;"</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Set device name (eventually needed for device reset, this should be a unique identifier containing only letters and numbers. Get it with <span class="command">lsusb</span> (don't listen to what Sakis3G says).<br>
      Example: lsusb may return the device name string: <span class="out">ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM MF110/MF627/MF636</span>. Any unique part of this name is ok to take as the device name. So, <span class="command">--devicename "MF636"</span> would be appropriate here.</div>
      <span class="command">--statfilepath "&lt;path&gt;"</span> (formerly <span class="command">--statpath"</span>)<br>
			<div class="indent">Write statistics files to this location. (default: script path)</div>
      <span class="command">--temppath "&lt;path&gt;"</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Specify alternative path for temporary files. The default is to make a subdirectory in <span class="path">/run/</span> or <span class="path">/var/run/</span> (whichever is found), which is a tmpFS (ramdisk) filesystem on most platforms, and therefore the contents are lost on shutdown.</div>
      <span class="command">--htmlpath "&lt;path&gt;"</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Webserver path to copy the stats HTML file to. (default: empty - do not copy)</div>
      <span class="command">--httpport &lt;port&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Port on which the internal webserver is listening. Setting the port implies <span class="command">--httpserver</span>. (default: 8000)</div>
	    <span class="command">--limitday &lt;limit&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Set daily transfer limit (in bytes).</div>
      <span class="command">--limitmonth &lt;limit&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Set monthly transfer limit (in bytes).</div>
      <span class="command">--monthstart &lt;day&gt;</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Day of month when monthly count begins. This is typically the day on which your monthly contract starts.</div>
      <span class="command">--sakisswitches "&lt;switches&gt;"</span><br>
			<div class="indent">Set switches to pass to Sakis3g.</div>
      <span class="command">--sakisoperators "&lt;operators&gt;"</span><br>

Also, there is a tutorial about setting up a NAS (network storage) using the RasPi which can be combined with the gateway/router function, and a good collection of other RasPi related stuff. Check out his site.<br>
